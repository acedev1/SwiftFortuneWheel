## Port to Other Platforms

### macOS

**SwiftFortuneWheel** is ported to **macOS** at `version 1.1.0` and should be work natively. However, you should note that the `SwiftFortuneWheel` view could be clipped with `NSView`, in order to fix that, you can add the inner spacing with auto-layout in your constrains and you need also specify `alignmentRectInsets` in the configuration.

### tvOS

**SwiftFortuneWheel** is compatible with **tvOS 9** and above starting from `version 1.1.0` and should work the same as on iOS.

### watchOS

I'm not considering the port to **watchOS**. At least Iâ€™m not seeing any reason to do so, due to limitations that **watchOS** has. However, port to **swiftUI** with support with **watchOS** thinkable.
